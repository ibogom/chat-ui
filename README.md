This project was started as development tools that should help web developers create new web sites/application. 

## Installation

After confirming that your environment meets the above requirements, you can create a new project based on `react-redux-boilerplate` by doing the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ibogom/spotim-chat.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

When that's done, install the project dependencies with `npm install`.

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the Project

After completing the installation step, you're ready to start the project!

```bash
$ npm run start  # Start the development server
```

## Project structure

The project structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type. This structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. That said, it aims to represent generally accepted guidelines and patterns for building scalable applications

I am using `jest` for testing.  So everything you need is just open you console/terminal and type following command:

```bash
$ npm run test
```
